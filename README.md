## Getting Started
This repository exposed here, is actually a university project of the course `hardware software co-design`

And implemented with `SystemC` language.

- ### Prerequisites
  - #### Installing SystemC
  
    SystemC is a set of C++ classes and macros which provide an event-driven simulation interface.
    
    You can see the ***SystemC installation*** documentation for each one:
    
      - [linux]()
      - [mac]()
      - [windows]()
      
  - #### Installing GtkWave
    
    Gtkwave is a software for displaying signals simulation in a vawe figure.
    
    You can produce a **.vcd** output file via systemc
    Then you can open it via gtkwave software and watch the simulation.
    
    Download gtkwave in ***Ubuntu*** by using:
    
    <pre> sudo apt install gtkwave </pre>
    
- ### Subject
  - #### Problem
    
    You can figure it out what the project exactly is about here: [project description]()
    
  - #### Solution
    
    You can see the design, architecture and the datapath of this project here: [project-design]() 
    
<hr />

## Proof Of Concepts
      
  The datapath of the hardware consists of:
    
  - PC (program counter)
  - IR (instruction memory)
  - IF (instruction fetch phase middle register - for pipelining)
  - RegFile (register file)
  - ID (instruction decode phase middle register - for piplining)
  - ALU (arithmetic/logic unit)
  - EXE (instruction execution phase middle register - for piplining)
  - MEM (share memory between micro and accelerator)
  - WB (instruction write back phase middle register - for piplinig)
  - Mux3 (multiplexer with 3 bits data and 1 bit selector)
  - Mux8 (multiplexer with 8 bits data and 1 bit selector)
