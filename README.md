## Getting Started
This repository which exposed here, is actually a university project for the course `hardware software co-design`

And implemented by `SystemC` language.

- ### Prerequisites
  - #### Installing SystemC
  
    SystemC is a set of C++ classes and macros which provide an event-driven simulation interface and is available for windows/mac/linux operating systems
    
    You can see the ***SystemC installation*** documentation for each one:
    
      - [linux]()
      - [mac]()
      - [windows]()
      
  - #### Installing GtkWave
    
    Gtkwave is a software for displaying signal simulation in vawe figure.
    
    You can produce a .vcd output file via systemc that is the final simulation
    
    Then you can open it via gtkwave software and watch the simulation.
    
    You can download gtkwave in ***Ubuntu*** by using:
    
    <pre> sudo apt install gtkwave </pre>
